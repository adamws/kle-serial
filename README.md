# kle-serial

[https://adamws.github.io/kle-serial](https://adamws.github.io/kle-serial/)

Webpage for manipulating [keyboard-layout-editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/) layouts.

## Features

- [x] JSON manipulation and conversion to [ijprest/kle-serial](https://github.com/ijprest/kle-serial) internal form
- [x] Included patch for key rotation issue (thanks to [@kevin-wells](https://github.com/ijprest/kle-serial/pull/1))
  which is not yet included in origin repository
- [x] Simplified render of resulting keyboard


### Disclaimer

This is playground, perhaps eventually it will become better version of
unmaintained ([see this](https://github.com/ijprest/keyboard-layout-editor/issues/218)) keyboard-layout-editor.

Originally this was created just for [kicad-kbplacer](https://github.com/adamws/kicad-kbplacer) which
required layout in 'internal' form. That version is still deployed at [keyboard-tools.xyz](https://keyboard-tools.xyz/kle-converter).
